# Electrical System

The electrical system on the Fergurson tractor is composed a battery, generator, voltage regulator, ammeter, starting motor, starting switch, coil, distributor, spark plugs, and wiring. 


## Battery

The battery used in the TO-20, TO-30, and early TO-35<sup>Note</sup> tractors is a 6-volt (3 Cell), 8O ampre-hour lead-acid battery.  The battery is positively grounded to the tractar frame. The battery supplies the necessary electrical en-ergy to the starting motor and ignition system for starting purposes and also suppliments the generator charging rate when the load demands placed upon it are greater than the generatar output.

The correct size battery is a BCI Group 1 (Maximum Overall Dimensions Length 9 1/8" x Width	7 1/8" x Height 9 3/8")

| Charge % | Voltage |
|:--------:|:-------:|

Note: TO-35s switched to 12V at SN 161250 (except for 300 Specials (163533-163832) that had 6V systems)

## Ignition / Light Switch

The switch used on the TO-30 is a combanation light and ignition switch.  The switch has three terminal and four postions.  The postions are off, ignition, ignition and lights, and lights. The terminals on the switched are marked "B" for battery, "I" for ignition, and "L" for lights.

The ignition terminal of the switch is connected to the negative low tension terminal of the coil.  The battery terminal of the switch if connected load termnial of the voltage regulator.  If lights are intsalled on the tractor connect them to the light terminal of the switch.

## Generator

## Voltage Regulator

The same voltage regulator is used in TO-20, TO-30, TO-35 tractors. Designed for 6 volt A type circuits in positive ground systems with 2 brush generators with outputs of 7 to 9 output amps. The voltage regulator has 4 terminals, 3 on one side ("L" load/lights, "BAT" battery, "F" field) ) and 1 on the opposite ("GEN" generator).

## Ammeter
The TO-30 tractor is equipped with an ammeter in place of the warning light utilized in the TO-20.  The ammeter is intended to let the operator know if the battery is charging or discharging.  

The ammeter is connected in series with the charging circuit.  All current flowing to and from the battery passes through the ammeter.  The ammeter is placed between the “hot” side of the starter switch and the battery ”BAT” terminal of the voltage regulator.

## Starting Motor

## Starting Switch

The starter switch is mounted on the transmission housing just forward of the steering column, and is held in place by four cap screws. The contact points are completely sealed against the entrance of dust and moisture. The switch is actuated by a rocker on the underside of the switch which in turn is actuated by the connecting link from the forward end of the reverse shifter rail. Contact is made by moving the gear shih lever in the direction opposite to the reverse position.

To remove the starter switch:

1. Disconnect the three wires from the switch and remove four bolts holding the switch to the transmission housing.
2. Raise and tilt the switch forward. Secure the connecting link with a piece of wire to prevent it from dropping down.
3. Remove the cotter pin and clevis pin that attaches the rocker to the switch bracket.
4. Remove the two cap screws holding the switch to the switch bracket.

The starter switch is serviced as a unit and defective switches should be replaced rather than attempting to repair the old switch. 

Installation of the starter switch:
When replacing the switch, assemble the switch to the switch bracket, attach the rocker to the connecting link and secure the clevis pin with a cotter pin. Remove the wire attached to the link and place the switch in position. Replace the retaining cap screws but leave them loose and adjust the switch as follows:

1. Move the switch in the slotted holes as far toward the rear as possible and tighten a couple of cap screws.
2. Test by shifting the gear shift lever into start position. If the switch fails to make contact or makes poor contact, loosen the bolts and move the switch forward slightly and check the contact in the new position.
3. Repeat the above until the switch makes a good full contact.

Caution: Mounting the switch too far for- ward will tend to cause the switch to jam and stick.
