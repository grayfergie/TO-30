# Electrical System

The electrical system on the Fergurson tractor is composed a battery, generator, voltage regulator, ammeter, starting motor, starting switch, coil, distributor, spark plugs, and wiring. 


## Battery

## Ignition / Light Switch

The switch used on the TO-30 is a combanation light and ignition switch.  The switch has three terminal and four postions.  The postions are off, ignition, ignition and lights, and lights. The terminals on the switched are marked "B" for battery, "I" for ignition, and "L" for lights.

The ignition terminal of the switch is connected to the negative low tension terminal of the coil.  The battery terminal of the switch if connected load termnial of the voltage regulator.  If lights are intsalled on the tractor connect them to the light terminal of the switch.

## Generator

## Voltage Regulator

The same voltage regulator is used in TO-20, TO-30, TO-35 tractors. Designed for 6 volt A type circuits in positive ground systems with 2 brush generators with outputs of 7 to 9 output amps. The voltage regulator has 4 terminals, 3 on one side ("L" load/lights, "BAT" battery, "F" field) ) and 1 on the opposite ("GEN" generator).
